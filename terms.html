        </div>

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>1. Merchant of Record & Global Compliance</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">Our order process is conducted by our online reseller <strong>FastSpring.com</strong>. FastSpring is the Merchant of Record for all our orders.

            <h2>2. Intellectual Property & Ownership</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">All software code, Terraform modules, and architectural designs are the exclusive property of <strong>RUWANPURAGE PAVITHRA PARAMI RANASINGHE</strong>. 
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-slate-400">
                <li><strong>Single Use:</strong> One purchase equals one production environment license.</li>

        </div>

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>3. Strict Refund Policy</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">Due to the nature of digital "Infrastructure-as-Code" (IaC) assets, which are immediately accessible and non-returnable upon purchase:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-slate-400">
                <li><strong>All sales are final.</strong> No refunds will be issued once the code repository has been accessed or downloaded.</li>
                <li>Refunds are only considered for duplicate transactions or documented technical failures of the payment gateway.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>4. Security Responsibility Disclaimer</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">While this kit includes security hardening (KMS encryption, VPC isolation), the <strong>Customer</strong> is solely responsible for the final security configuration of their AWS account. The Company is not liable for any data breaches, resource misconfigurations, or financial losses resulting from the use of this code in a live environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-box">

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>6. Unauthorized Redistribution</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">Redistribution, reselling, or sharing the source code in public repositories (GitHub/GitLab) is a direct breach of this agreement. Any unauthorized distribution will result in immediate license revocation and potential legal action for copyright infringement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>7. Support & Maintenance Limits</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">This is a one-time architectural asset purchase. The Company is under no obligation to provide ongoing technical support, bug fixes for future AWS provider changes, or custom engineering unless a separate "Enterprise Support" retainer is active.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term-box">
            <h2>8. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-400">We collect minimal data (Name, Email, IP) for licensing verification. We comply with GDPR and CCPA standards. Financial data is never stored on our servers; it is handled exclusively by FastSpring's PCI-DSS Level 1 secure servers.</p>
